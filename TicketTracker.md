# Ticket Tracker

## API Description
We would like to design a simple API that returns the number of tickets issued by red light and speed cameras in Winnipeg at a given intersection in the last week.   

This API could be used by motorists, navigation systems and anyone who is interested in tracking the current trends in photo radar ticketing in the city of Winnipeg.

The caller can send two street names to one of two endpoints and our API will return either the number of speeding tickets issued at that intersection or the number of red light tickets issued at that intersection depending on the endpoint accessed.
